Objective

The objective of this project is to replicate the google search results page as best as possible using HTML/CSS only. Practice with git and github is included.

Reflection

With my knowledge of HTML/CSS i believe flexbox may have made some portions of the page a bit easier to build. However, I decided to challenge myself by learning more about other HTML elements and CSS properties. As a result, I have gained more knowledge with this project.
